Known Issues
---
- Overlay will not work in the editor but will work in export projects when uploaded to Steam.  This seems to a limitation with Vulkan currently.

Quick How-To
---
Obtain the plugin through one of two ways:
- Visit the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/7469) either through the website or in the editor and search for GodotSteam.
- Download this repo and unzip it into the base of your game project.

You will need to add the steam_appid.txt file with 480 or your game's app ID to where ever you have your Godot editor.  It should just work without having to do anything else.

Tinker with Steamworks!
